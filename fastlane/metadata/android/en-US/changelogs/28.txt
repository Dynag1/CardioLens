Scientific RHR Update:
- Refined "True RHR" Algorithm: Now uses the average of the lowest stable baseline (Standardized Scientific Method).
- Strict Activity Exclusion: Workouts (Yoga, Weights, etc.) are now actively filtered out from RHR calculation to prevent artificial inflation.
- Precision Polish: Fixed rounding logic to eliminate 1 BPM discrepancies between devices.
- Optimizations: Improved data fetching speed and caching for history graphs.
- Data Efficiency: Smart resolution switching (Seconds for workouts, Minutes for rest) to optimize performance.
